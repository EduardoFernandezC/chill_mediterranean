# Chill projections for the Mediterranean region

This repository contains the code and part of the data generated to
assess the impacts of climate change on the Mediterranean. Our analysis
is framed by the [AdaMedOr](https://twitter.com/AdaMedOr1) project.

Using the `chillR` package (Luedeling 2021), we listed 5,000 available
weather stations close the Mediterranean area. These weather stations
are available from the [Global Summary Of the Day
(GSOD)](https://data.noaa.gov/dataset/dataset/global-surface-summary-of-the-day-gsod)
database. After some filtering, we identified 792 weather stations
starting the recording before 1974 and finishing after 2020 as well as
located between the latitude 25° and 48°.
